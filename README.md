# Vincent Starter Kit

A complete example repository for Vincent Ability and Policy authors. This monorepo uses Nx and pnpm and includes:

- A Vincent Ability that monitors Cornerstone projects and rebalances Uniswap V3 LP positions
- A Vincent Policy that rate-limits ability executions
- End-to-end tests that automatically build, deploy, and exercise the ability and policy

### See detailed documentation / guides at [docs.heyvincent.ai](https://docs.heyvincent.ai)

## Requirements

- Node.js: ^20.19.4
- pnpm: 10.7.0 (managed via Corepack)

### Using Corepack to use pnpm

This repo is configured to use pnpm and enforces it in the preinstall step. If you do not have pnpm set up, use Corepack:

```bash
# Enable Corepack globally (ships with Node 16.9+)
corepack enable

# Ensure npm & pnpm shims are enabled
corepack enable npm
corepack enable pnpm

# Or run the helper script from the repo root
pnpm run use-corepack
```

Notes:

- The repo sets "packageManager": "pnpm@10.7.0" in package.json. Corepack will automatically provision that version.
- The preinstall script scripts/check-packagemanager.sh verifies Node and Corepack are available and enforces pnpm via `npx only-allow pnpm`.

## Scripts

Root-level scripts you will commonly use:

Project-level Nx targets you may find useful (run via pnpm nx ...):

## Bootstrap flow

The bootstrap script guides you through configuring the repo for the first time and preparing the E2E environment.

Command:

```bash
pnpm bootstrap
```

What happens:

1. Pinata JWT setup
   - A Pinata JWT is required for e2e tests and for publishing Vincent Abilities and Policies to the Registry.
   - You will be prompted to obtain a Pinata JWT from https://app.pinata.cloud/developers/api-keys.
   - The JWT you provide will be stored in a root-level .env as `PINATA_JWT`. Tooling will use this to authenticate with Pinata.
   - If you already have a .env file, the script will skip this step.
2. Funder environment setup for E2E
   - You must fund a wallet with testLPX on the LIT testnet (Yellowstone). You can fund your wallet using the faucet as https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/
   - Once you have funded your wallet, you must provide its private key for usage by tooling in the repository.
   - The bootstrap process creates additional test private keys (app manager, app delegatee, agent wallet PKP owner) and stores those keys in packages/cornerstone-lp-rebalancer-e2e/.env.test-e2e

Notes:

- If a root .env already exists, the Pinata JWT step is skipped.
- If packages/cornerstone-lp-rebalancer-e2e/.env.test-e2e already exists, bootstrap aborts with an error so you donâ€™t overwrite your private keys. Use `pnpm reset-e2e` to back up the existing .env.test-e2e file, and re-run bootstrap.

## Quick start

It is recommended to use Corepack to ensure pnpm is used for the repository's package management. If you use a different package manager, you may experience problematic behavior.

1. Verify your version of corepack and ensure you are on > 0.31.0
   ```bash
   corepack -v
   npm install -g corepack@latest
   ```
2. Enable Corepack:
   ```bash
   corepack enable && corepack enable pnpm
   ```
3. Run bootstrap to build and configure the repository :
   ```bash
   pnpm bootstrap
   ```
4. (Optional) Configure a test registry address:

   ```bash
   # In packages/cornerstone-lp-rebalancer-e2e/.env.test-e2e
   TEST_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0xYourCornerstoneRegistryAddress
   ```

   If not configured, the test will use a placeholder address. For full end-to-end testing with real data, deploy a Cornerstone registry contract and configure this address.

5. Run the example end-to-end test flow:
   ```bash
   pnpm test-e2e
   ```
